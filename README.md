# Projects
Welcome to my Data Analytics portfolio! This GitHub is a curated collection of projects that highlight my skills in data analysis, visualization, and storytelling. Each repository showcases not only the code but also the thought process behind my approach to solving real-world problems with data. From cleaning and exploring datasets to building dashboards and deriving insights, this space reflects my passion for turning data into meaningful action.
