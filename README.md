# Projects
Welcome to my Data Analytics portfolio! This GitHub is a curated collection of projects that highlight my skills in Python and my passion for uncovering the stories hidden within data. Each repository showcases not only the code, but also the thought process behind my approach to solving real-world problems. From cleaning and exploring datasets to deriving insights, this space reflects my dedication to turning data into meaningful action.
